# Micro IT Internship Projects

I selected the File Encryption/Decryption Tool because I found it to be a unique. While working on it, I learned a lot about data security and developed interest towards this.
For the Password Generator, I am the one who always skips the "Generate Password" option and preferred using my own password. But when I came across this project, I decided to explore how password generation works. I enjoyed building it and completed it enthusiastically.
Although I also developed other projects like Rock-Paper-Scissors, Calculator, and Portfolio Website but I chose to submit the File Encryption Tool and Password Generator because they best reflect both the uniqueness of the idea and my intrest in them.

This repository contains two projects developed during the Micro IT Internship:

---

 1. File Encryption and Decryption Tool

###  Description
A GUI-based tool built using `Tkinter` and `cryptography` to **securely encrypt and decrypt files**. It ensures the safety of your sensitive data using AES encryption provided by the `Fernet` module.

### Features
- Generate a unique encryption key.
- Encrypt any file (text, PDF, etc.).
- Decrypt only using the correct key.
- GUI interface with success/error messages.

###  How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. Use the GUI to select files for encryption or decryption.
3. Ensure the key (`message.key`) remains safe for decryption.

 2. Password Generator

###  Description
A command-line tool to generate **strong, random passwords** based on user preferences â€” length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

### Features
- User-defined password length.
- Uppercase letters
-  Lowercase letters
- Digits
- Special characters
